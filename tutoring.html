		<p class="title">Tutoring: Explained</p>
		<p>Hi tutors!  We are excited to be hosting peer tutoring during Tiger Paws again this year.  We have sign-ups for Spanish, French, Social Studies, ELA, Math, and Science.  To see how each subject fits into the Tiger Paws schedule, please refer to the sign-up Libguide.  Your presence not only assists students who need academic support, but it also helps us make the library a more studious environment.
		<br>
		Last year, we had a few instances where tutors did not show up for the dates they booked. Due to the popularity of these tutoring slots, we have a one strike policy. If a tutor fails to report during a Tiger PAWS session, we will cancel them from the remainder of the month and email out the available dates so that other students can sign up. This has not been a huge issue, but we want to make sure students are available when needed!  If you cannot attend your tutoring session, please try to switch with another students or at the very least, contact Mrs. Neneman or Ms. Gojcevic in the library or by e-mailing us at cneneman@bluevalleyk12.org or mgojcevic@bluevalleyk12.org and you wonâ€™t be cancelled from your other spots.
		<br>
		We really appreciate you all and hope that this program is beneficial to you as well.  We are looking forward to another great year!
		<br>
