		<p class="title">Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church Annual Festival located 12001 Wornall Rd., KCMO 64145.</p>  
		<p>I could use helpers during the following days and times:<br>  
		Friday, Sept. 7: 3pm to 6 pm and 6pm to 9 pm, 4 helpers each shift (school day, so arrival a little later than 3pm is ok)<br> 
		Saturday, Sept. 8: 10 am to 2pm, 2 pm to 6 pm, 6 pm to 10 pm, 4 helpers each shift <br>
		Sunday, Sept 9: 11 am to 3 pm, 3pm to 7 pm, 4 helpers each shift<br> 
		It's not physically hard work (except a lot of standing), so volunteers can work more than one shift if they wish.  Volunteers will be boxing and labeling desserts and should bring a hat.  Apron and gloves will be provided.  Workroom is air-conditioned and lots of fun.<br>   
		People with nut allergies probably shouldn't volunteer.  Contact Denise Chambers no later than Sept. 5 to schedule a time. denisevchambers@gmail.com or 816.786.5454 (call or text)</p>

			<p class="title">Blessings Abound Thrift Store</p>
			<p>My name is Laura Anderson and I am the volunteer coordinator for Blessings Abound Thrift Store in Overland Park. We are a nonprofit that accepts donations of gently used items for resale.  We then donate all profits to local organizations helping those in need through food pantries, job training, home repair assistance, and much more. In order to reach the most people, we rely on the generosity of the community and volunteers.  That's where you come in!</p>
			<p>We have a wide variety of tasks that students can assist with and we are open until 6 during the week as well as on Saturdays to accommodate the school schedule.  Please contact me at the number below if you are interested in serving at this Thrift Store.</p>
