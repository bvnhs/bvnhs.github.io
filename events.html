			<p class="title">Blessings Abound Thrift Store</p>
			<p>My name is Laura Anderson and I am the volunteer coordinator for Blessings Abound Thrift Store in Overland Park. We are a nonprofit that accepts donations of gently used items for resale.  We then donate all profits to local organizations helping those in need through food pantries, job training, home repair assistance, and much more. In order to reach the most people, we rely on the generosity of the community and volunteers.  That's where you come in!</p>
			<p>We have a wide variety of tasks that students can assist with and we are open until 6 during the week as well as on Saturdays to accommodate the school schedule.  Please contact me at the number below if you are interested in serving at this Thrift Store.</p>  



			<p>Thank you!<br>
